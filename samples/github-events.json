For F#-to-C#, yes.

And the guidelines suggest the same thing: \"Do not throw System.Exception when it will escape to user code. This includes avoiding the use of failwith [...]\".  But in fact it is not so.  I know from experience that it throws something else, and [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233235.aspx) says that it's Microsoft.FSharp.Core.FailureException (a good reason not to use failwith in F#-to-C# scenario).\r\n\r\n3) `In fact, the very next sentence says you should use \"None option value\" for normal control flow - but this could be extended by adding \"or custom discriminated union\".`  Yes, agreed.

They are about input validation - and it is not unexpected that the input will be invalid. The Chessie project makes it easy to collect a list of (expected) validation errors together with a final result. This is a case where using DUs makes a lot of sense because you have more complicated logic than with plain exceptions (accumulating validation messages) and the result is really \"extended result\" rather than just error.\n\n**Unexpected error cases**\nOn the other hand, if you are handling exceptional cases (that should not normally happen), then I don't see a reason for *not* using exceptions. That is, if the control flow is \"whenever something goes wrong, jump to the first recovery point\", then it makes a lot more sense to use exceptions - they have nice language support (do not require funky operators or additional boilerplate) and they have been designed for this case.\n\n**Summary**\nSo, I think that the wording in the guidelines is actually still valid - it says that you should use exceptions in unexpected exceptional cases - and I think this is a good advice. In fact, the very next sentence says you should use \"None option value\" for normal control flow - but this could be extended by adding \"or custom discriminated union\". \n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-05-09T01:01:26Z","org":{"id":485415,"login":"fsharp","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/fsharp","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485415?"}},{"id":"2790084756","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":573979,"login":"baronfel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baronfel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/573979?"},"repo":{"id":2361876,"name":"fsharp/fsharp.github.io","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fsharp/fsharp.github.io"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fsharp/fsharp.github.io/issues/28","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fsharp/fsharp.github.io/issues/28/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fsharp/fsharp.github.io/issues/28/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fsharp/fsharp.github.io/issues/28/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp.github.io/issues/28","id":74519829,"number":28,"title":"Guidelines over exceptions vs success/failure results","user":{"login":"isaacabraham","id":1781813,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781813?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham","html_url":"https://github.com/isaacabraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacabraham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-05-08T22:40:37Z","updated_at":"2015-05-09T00:00:10Z","closed_at":null,"body":"I'm referring to http://fsharp.org/specs/component-design-guidelines/#do-follow-the-net-guidelines-for-exceptions-including-for-f-to-f-libraries and ultimately to this thread on twitter https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham/status/596724853274710016.\r\n\r\nWhat are peoples thoughts on handling \"error cases\" in terms of guidance?
